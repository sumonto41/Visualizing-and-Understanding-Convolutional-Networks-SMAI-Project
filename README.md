# task performed by Sumonto Chatterjee(2022201028) is present in the following notebooks:
  - adversarial_attack.ipynb 
  - alexnet_vizz.ipynb
  - vgg_vizz.ipynb
# task performed by Subhadeep Biswas(2022201039) is in the "feature invariance" directory.
# task performed by Soumadeep Acharya(2022201059) is in the "2022201059_projject.ipynb" notebook

- images folder contains the images used for visualization and invariance.
- labels.json contains the labels of ImageNet classes.

- modiff_1.npy, modiff_2.npy, modiff_3.npy are the numpy files where the adversarial images are stored as numpy arrays.

all the tasks are performed in python notebooks and all the dependencies and libraries are already present in the notebooks which can be installed during runtime.
